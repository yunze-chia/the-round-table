Lancelot
A complex character with many underlying motivations, Lancelot can be driven
towards either Good or Evil.

Variant #1: Lancelot switches allegiance during the game
Set Up
Use both Lancelot character cards included in the promo in place of one
Good and One Evil character card.
Build a Loyalty deck of 5 cards – three “No Change” (blank) cards and
two “Switch Allegiance” cards. Shuffle and place the Loyalty deck
adjacent to the Score Tableau.
Reveal Phase
The Evil Lancelot does not open his eyes, but instead extends his thumb
so that he is known to the other agents of Evil.
Play – game play proceeds as normal, with the following exceptions:
At the beginning of the 3rd round and at the very start of each
subsequent round flip one card from the Loyalty deck. If the card is “No
Change”, there is no change of allegiance and play continues as normal.
If the “Switch Allegiance” card is drawn, Lancelot has had a change of
heart. The two Lancelot players secretly switch their allegiances. This
switch applies to all aspects of game play including victory conditions
and rules regarding playing Quest cards. They do not swap or show
their Character cards.
It is possible that Lancelot will switch allegiance once, twice or even not at all
during a game.

Variant #2: Similar to variant #1, except that Lancelot’s allegiance switch(s) is
known in advance and the Evil Lancelot must Fail any Quests he is on.
Set Up
Use both Lancelot character cards included in the promo in place of one
Good and One Evil character card.
Build a Loyalty deck of 7 cards – five “No Change” (blank) cards and two
“Switch Allegiance” cards. Shuffle and place the Loyalty deck adjacent
to the Score Tableau.
Reveal Phase
The Evil Lancelot does not open his eyes, but instead extends his thumb
so that he is known to the other agents of Evil.
Play – game play proceeds as normal, with the following exceptions:
At the beginning of the game deal, face-up, five Loyalty cards above the
Scoring Tableau in a manner that makes the order of cards
distinguishable. These cards will indicate if and when Lancelot will switch
allegiance during the game. A switch of allegiance takes effect at the
beginning of the round corresponding to the order in which the “Switch
Allegiance” card is placed.
Options on playing Quest cards are eliminated. The player that is the
current Evil Lancelot must play a Quest Fail card. The player that is the
current Good Lancelot must play a Quest Success card as normal.
If the “Switch Allegiance” card is drawn for a round, Lancelot has had a
change of heart. The two Lancelot players secretly switch their
allegiances at the beginning of the round. This switch applies to all
aspects of game play including victory conditions and rules regarding
playing Quest cards. They do not swap or show their Character cards.
It is possible that Lancelot will switch allegiance once, twice or even not at all
during a game.

Variant #3: The Good and Evil Lancelot players know each other. Recommended
for larger groups only.
Set Up
Use both Lancelot character cards included in the promo in place of one
Good and One Evil character card.
Reveal Phase - Add a step to the end of the script as follows:
“Lancelot open your eyes to reveal your counterpart”
“Lancelot close your eyes”
